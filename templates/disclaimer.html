        <h2>1. Nature of Service</h2>
        <p>CE Tracker is a free personal record-keeping tool designed to help professionals organize and track their Continuing Education (CE) credits. This tool <strong>does not submit, report, or file anything</strong> with the CFP Board, AICPA, CFA Institute, IRS, NASBA, any state licensing board, or any other regulatory or credentialing body. All data entered remains solely within this application for your personal reference.</p>

        <h2>2. No Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>Nothing provided by CE Tracker constitutes legal, tax, accounting, financial, or compliance advice. Use of this tool does not create a professional, fiduciary, advisory, or client relationship of any kind between you and CE Tracker or its creators. You should consult qualified professionals for advice specific to your situation and compliance obligations.</p>

        <h2>3. No Regulatory Affiliation</h2>
        <p>CE Tracker is <strong>not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by</strong> the CFP Board, AICPA, CFA Institute, IRS, NASBA, any state board of accountancy, The American College of Financial Services, Investments &amp; Wealth Institute, or any other professional organization, regulatory body, or credentialing institution.</p>
